<p>The Ancient World Digital Library (AWDL) is an initiative of the <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for the Study of the Ancient World</a> (ISAW) at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>. AWDL will identify, collect, curate, and provide access to a broad range of scholarly materials relevant to the study of the ancient world.</p>
<p>With NYU's <a href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/dlts/" target="_blank">Digital Library Technology Services</a> (DLTS), AWDL is developing mechanisms to digitize, preserve, and host digitized print and born-digital scholarly content. We are actively soliciting <a href="/ancientworld/partners/" target="_blank">partnerships</a> with publishers, scholarly societies, organizations, and individuals who hold the rights to scholarly content as we expand our collection.</p>
